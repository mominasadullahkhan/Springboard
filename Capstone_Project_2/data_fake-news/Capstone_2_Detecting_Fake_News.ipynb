    "# Predicting Fake News - Final Report\n",
    "The dataset is about fake news articles; the name of the author, the title of the article, the text of the article and whether it is fake or real is included in this dataset. It can be found on Kaggle:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: The dataset above is simulated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "A popular social media company has hired us to investigate fake news article and develop models that can flag articles that are fake so they can be removed from their platform and not propogate misinformation. These news articles are polarizing people on their platform and the effects are pouring over into everyday life. They want to let their users know which articles are fake by flagging them or removing them altogther. Customers are swithcing to competitor platforms where this problem has already been handled. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Client\n",
    "Social Media Company \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "My objective is to gain insight into what features fake news articles consist of and if they can be distinguished. The ultimate goal is to create models that can accurately predict if an article is fake or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of Analytical Pipeline\n",
    "This project follows a typical data science pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First approach in solving the problem is obtaining the relevant data.\n",
    "2. Cleaning the data is the next step. This includes checking for null values, imputing missing values and checking column names\n",
    "3. Next, we explore the data to gain insights into our dataset and what it contains. This includes looking for outliers or unusual data as well as using a correlation matrix to understand the relationship between the response and predictor variables.\n",
    "4. Modeling using Machine Learning gives us our predictive power on whether the bank will lose a customer or not.\n",
    "5. Lastly, we interpret the results and see what can we conlcude about bank customers leaving the bank. For example, what feature variable was most indicative of customers leaving the bank?"
